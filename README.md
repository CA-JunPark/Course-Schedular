Motivation and Background of the Project
TWU’s Course Registration page does not support a visual course schedule. It only has a chart of courses with the time like TR 3:00 PM-4:15 PM. Also it is inconvenient that students cannot see their current registered schedule while they are browsing other available courses. Therefore, TWU students are experiencing inconvenience.

Therefore, the visual application will help students to plan their schedule with the visual course scheduler before they actually add their courses to their schedule at the TWU Course Registration page. It is more intuitive to look at the timetable with the visual chart. So it is much easier to plan the semester with the visual course scheduler.

The main purpose of this application is to make the course choosing process more efficient and convenient, user friendly, and providing a sort function that TWU registration site lacks.

Targeted Users
Trinity Western University Students.


The project CourseScheduler is created for Trinity Western Students, potentially stretching to other universities, depending if they have the same issue. The app will be made user friendly, unlike the TWU course registration portal, where the course selection process requires students to have multiple tabs open, constantly refreshing and alternating between two pages when a course they selected does not match their timetable. This project will integrate MySQL and JavaFx to create an application that helps TWU students choose and select courses without being worrisome of time conflicts, and making the course registration process faster.
